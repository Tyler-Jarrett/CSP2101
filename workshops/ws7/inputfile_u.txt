<h2>The creation of Linux</h2>
<p style="standardtext">In 1991, while studying computer science at the <a href="https://www.helsinki.fi/en">University of Helsinki</a>, <strong>Linus Torvalds</strong> began a project that later became the Linux kernel. He wrote the program specifically for the hardware he was using and independent of an operating system because he wanted to use the functions of his new PC with an 80386 processor. Development was done on MINIX using the GNU C Compiler. The GNU C Compiler is still the main choice for compiling Linux today, but can be built with other compilers, such as the Intel C Compiler.</p>
<p style="standardtext">As Torvalds wrote in his book <em>Just for Fun</em>,he eventually ended up writing an operating system kernel. On 25 August 1991, he (at age 21) announced this system in a Usenet posting to the newsgroup <em>comp.os.minix</em></p>
<p style="standardtext">According to Torvalds, Linux began to gain importance in 1992 after the Windows System was ported to Linux by Orest Zborowski, which allowed Linux to support a GUI for the first time.</p>
<p style="standardtext">Linus Torvalds had wanted to call his invention Freax, a portmanteau of "free", "freak", and "x" (as an allusion to Unix). During the start of his work on the system, he stored the files under the name "Freax" for about half of a year. Torvalds had already considered the name "Linux", but initially dismissed it as too egotistical.</p>
<p style="standardtext">In order to facilitate development, the files were uploaded to the FTP server <strong>ftp.funet.fi</strong> of <em>FUNET</em> in September 1991. Ari Lemmke at Helsinki University of Technology (HUT), who was one of the volunteer administrators for the FTP server at the time, did not think that "Freax" was a good name. So, he named the project "Linux" on the server without consulting Torvalds. Later, however, Torvalds consented to "Linux".</p>
<p style="standardtext">Torvalds first published the Linux kernel under its own licence, which had a restriction on commercial activity.</p>
<p style="standardtext">The software to use with the kernel was software developed as part of the GNU project licensed under the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/">GNU General Public License</a>, a free software license. The first release of the Linux kernel, Linux 0.01, included a binary of GNU's Bash shell.</p>
<p style="standardtext">In 1992, he suggested releasing the kernel under the GNU General Public License. He first announced this decision in the release notes of version 0.12. In the middle of December 1992 he published version 0.99 using the GNU GPL. Linux and GNU developers worked to integrate GNU components with Linux to make a fully functional and free operating system.</p>
<p style="standardtext">Around 2000 Torvalds clarified that the used license for the Linux kernel is exactly the GPLv2, without the common "or later clause".</p>
<p style="standardtext">In 2007, after years of draft discussions, the GPLv3 was released and Torvalds and the majority of kernel developers decided against adopting the new license for the linux kernel.</p>
<p style="standardtext">The designation "Linux" was initially used by Torvalds only for the Linux kernel. The kernel was, however, frequently used together with other software, especially that of the GNU project. This quickly became the most popular adoption of GNU software. In June 1994 in GNU's bulletin, Linux was referred to as a "free UNIX clone", and the Debian project began calling its product <em>Debian GNU/Linux</em>. In May 1996, Richard Stallman published the editor Emacs 19.31, in which the type of system was renamed from Linux to Lignux. This spelling was intended to refer specifically to the combination of GNU and Linux, but this was soon abandoned in favor of "GNU/Linux".</p>
